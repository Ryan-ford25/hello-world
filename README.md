# hello-world
Hi
I would describe myself as a hard-working individual, someone with a positive, ‘can-do’ attitude. I always want to do the best I can and be the best person that I can be. I am used to working in fast paced and high pressure situations and will thrive in these environments. One of my traits is my communication skills, I am a very confident and respectful communicator both written and verbally, I enjoy meeting new people and being social. I also have been told that I am a “very happy” person as I always have a smile on my face. I'm a quick learner and a very quick thinker; I try to be as efficient and effective as I can be.
